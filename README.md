# PROGRAMACIO2-FIB
In this course we were asked to create our own EVALUATOR from scratch in C++. We had to create our own data classes, the program covering all the asked functionalities for the project, which consisted in a platform of programming courses and problem solving, described in the pdf file, using both iterative and recursive algorithms applied to the new data classes as well as simple classes and arborescent structures. Attached there is also our own sample input and expected output, as well as the html folder of a Doxygen file in order to visualize clearer my project.
