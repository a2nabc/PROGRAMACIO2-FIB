# PROGRAMACIO2-FIB
In this subject we were asked to create a whole project in C++. We had to create our own data classes, the program covering all the asked functionalities for the project "EVALUATOR: programming courses and problem solving platform", described in the README file, using both iterative and recursive algorithms applied to the new data classes as well as simple classes and arborescent structures. Attached there is also our own sample input and expected output, as well as the html folder of a Doxygen file in order to visualize clearer my project.
